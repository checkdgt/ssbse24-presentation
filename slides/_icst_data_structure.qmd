:::

## Generated Road Data {auto-animate=true}
- Roads generated in a 200x200 meter arena
- Given road data for evaluating our Tools
- Key elements for pass/ fail and road points

::: {.notes}
- Simulation based testing offers a cheaper alternative for validating models
- Allows us to quickly generate and validate various road combinations
- Tools such as BeamNG and Carla allow us to effectively achieve this
:::

## Competition Tool & Validation Data {auto-animate=true}
- Everything is dockerized
- Uses gRPC as a connectivity frameworkÂ¹
- Ensures all tools adhere to the same protocol for better evaluation
- Language independent
- Limited set of data given for evaluation
- Random selection tool given as baseline

- However, despite these methods, it is still common to create the starting points via random generation
- And then iteratively optimizing those generated points.
