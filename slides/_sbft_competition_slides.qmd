- Simulation based testing offers a cheaper alternative for validating models
- Allows us to quickly generate and validate various road combinations
- Tools such as BeamNG and Carla allow us to effectively achieve this

- However, despite these methods, it is still common to create the starting points via random generation
- And then iteratively optimizing those generated points.
