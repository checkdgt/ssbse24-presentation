## Model Prediction {auto-animate=true}
- Given just an ID and Road Points
- Create image from Road Points
- Image recognition model used for selection
- Gives prediction on whether road could fail
- Take test cases with a prediction greater than 0.6

- Simulation based testing offers a cheaper alternative for validating models
- Allows us to quickly generate and validate various road combinations
- Tools such as BeamNG and Carla allow us to effectively achieve this
:::

## Getting Greedy And Diversifying {auto-animate=true}
- Calculate diversity between test cases using euclidean distance
- Utilize greedy selection to create a diverse set of test case
- Starts with a random road (test case)
- Compares incremental diversity for selected cases against stored selection 
- Return selected cases to the evaluator

- However, despite these methods, it is still common to create the starting points via random generation
- And then iteratively optimizing those generated points.
