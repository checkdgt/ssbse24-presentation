## Running the road through the SBFT tool {auto-animate=true}
- SBFT tool validates if the road is valid
- No intersection
- No corners too sharp
- Runs the road in BeamNG simulator
- Allow for <50% OOB
- Max speed 85 km/h
- AI aggression 1.0

## Pass or fail {auto-animate=true}
- Save a road that causes a failure
- Add a road to the non-dominated list

- Fitness is based on the worse road point
- Finding those with the largest out of bounds percentage
- Fastest velocity the car reached the point at
- And the angle of the steering

## Retrieve fitness {auto-animate=true}
- Save a road that causes a failure
- Add a road to the non-dominated list
- Validate the fitness of the road

## Update non-dominated list {auto-animate=true}
- Save a road that causes a failure
- Add a road to the non-dominated list
- Validate the fitness of the road
- Assess road for the non-dominated list with 1+1 EA

- Loop through existing roads in non-dom list
- If the new road dominates on 1 or 2 points then it is added to the list
- If the new road dominates on all 3 points, the old road is removed and the new added
- If the new road doesn't dominate the old in any way then it is not added

## Update non-dominated list {auto-animate=true}
- Fitness based on points:
- OOB Percentage
- Velocity
- Angle

:::

## Rinse and repeat {auto-animate=true}
- Start the test over
- Randomly choose to evolve a new road
- Or one from the non-dominated list
- Repeat for 8 hours
- 8 full test iterations
