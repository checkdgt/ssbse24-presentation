## ICST/ SBFT Self-Driving Car Test Suite Regression Competition {auto-animate=true}
- New this year
- Competition to create optimized regression suites¹
- Uses road data as discussed in the SSBSE work

- Simulation based testing offers a cheaper alternative for validating models
- Allows us to quickly generate and validate various road combinations
- Tools such as BeamNG and Carla allow us to effectively achieve this
:::

## Competition goal {auto-animate=true}
- Create tool to predict failures
- Generate regression suites¹
- Use dataset on road passes and failures
- Ensure diversity of test cases
- Ensure regression suite executes in a timely manner

- However, despite these methods, it is still common to create the starting points via random generation
- And then iteratively optimizing those generated points.
